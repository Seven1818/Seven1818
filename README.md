### 🧩 Featured Projects

#### **Wind Tunnel Wheel-lift forces tool** *(Dallara — proprietary work)*
Ongoing development of in-house tools for measuring aerodynamic vertical forces on wheels in the wind tunnel without using wheel-pads.
**Tools:** Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
.
#### **CFD cooling simulations** *(DeepDrive — proprietary work)*
Conducted CFD simulations of air gap friction and heat transfer in high‑speed dual‑rotor electrical machines. Optimization of axial air flow in rotating electrical machines.
**Tools:** Ansys Fluent, Python, Linux.

#### **Battery ageing in electric vehicles: Development of a simulation tool for the North American homologation** *(Volkswagen AG — proprietary work)*
Bachelor thesis in collaboration with Volkswagen AG. Here I developed a battery ageing simulation‑tool in Python. 
**Tools:** Python, Numpy, Scipy, PyQt5.

#### **Development of a methodology for assessing the non‑limited emissions of petrol‑engined vehicles** *(Volkswagen AG — proprietary work)*
Term paper in collaboration with Volkswagen AG. Here I developed a methodology which could assess the risks of non‑limited emissions of petrol‑engined vehicles.
**Tools:** Python, Numpy, Scipy.

#### **Optimisation process of a Formula Student rear wing** *(Team Wob Racing)*
Term paper focused on the optimisation of a new endplate, part of my new rear wing design, using Ansys ACP. In this case, thanks to the simulations, it was possible to define the perfect carbon fibre lay‑up, reinforcing locally only the critical parts of the construction and thus saving weight.
**Tools:** Ansys Workbench, ACP, Star CCM+-
